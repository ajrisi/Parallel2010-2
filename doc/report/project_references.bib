abstract = {Sequence comparison is a basic operation in DNA sequencing projects, and most of sequence comparison methods used are based on heuristics, which are faster but there are no guarantees that the best alignments are produced. On the other hand, the algorithm proposed by Smith-Waterman obtains the best local alignments at the expense of very high computing power and huge memory requirements. In this article, we present and evaluate our experiments with three strategies to run the Smith-Waterman algorithm in a cluster of workstations using a distributed shared memory system. Our results on an eight-machine cluster presented very good speedups and indicate that impressive improvements can be achieved, depending on the strategy used.

In this paper, we wish to study the DNA sequencing problem known for its computational requirements which far exceed the computing capabilities of the fastest available sequential machines.

abstract = {We address in this paper the design and analysis of cost-optimal parallel algorithms for solving the problem of the longest common subsequence. Starting from the standard sequential dynamic programming algorithm which has the structure of a perfect nest of two embedded loops, we make use of a specific three-step parallelization approach consisting in (i) a dependence analysis within the nest ; (ii) the determination of a particular unimodular transformation leading to a new nest whose second loop is parallel ; (iii) the design of two linear time schedulings for the derived parallel algorithm when a given number of processors is available. The first scheduling is fitted to the nest structure while the second is greedy oriented and optimal. The makespans of the two schedulings are explicitly determined. This permits to establish a comparison showing their respective efficiencies.},

title = {A Fast Multiple Longest Common Subsequence (MLCS) Algorithm},
abstract = {Finding the longest common subsequence (LCS) of multiple strings is an NP-hard problem, with many applications in the areas of bioinformatics and computational genomics. Although significant efforts have been made to address the problem and its special cases, the increasing complexity and size of biological data require more efficient methods applicable to an arbitrary number of strings. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for the general case of multiple LCS (or MLCS) problem, i.e., finding a LCS of any number of strings, and its parallel realization. The algorithm is based on the dominant point approach and employs a fast divide-and-conquer technique to compute the dominant points. When applied to a case of 3 strings, our algorithm demonstrates the same performance as the fastest existing MLCS algorithm designed for that specific case. When applied to more than 3 strings, our algorithm is significantly faster than the best existing sequential methods, reaching up to 2-3 orders of magnitude faster speed on large-size problems. Finally, we present an efficient parallel implementation of the algorithm. Evaluating the parallel algorithm on a benchmark set of both random and biological sequences reveals a near-linear speed-up with respect to the sequential algorithm.},

title = {A Fast Parallel Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm Based on Pruning Rules},
abstract = {Searching for the longest common subsequence (LCS) of biosequences is one of the most important problems in bioinformatics. A fast algorithm for LCS problem FAST_LCS is presented. The algorithm first seeks the successors of the initial identical character pairs according to a successor table to obtain all the identical pairs and their levels. By tracing back from the identical character pair at the highest level, strong pruning rules are developed. For two sequences X and Y with length n and m, respectively, the memory required for FAST_LCS is max{4*(n+1)+4*(m+1), L}, where L is the number of identical character pairs. The time complexity of parallel computing is O(|LCS(X,Y)|), where |LCS(X,Y)| is the length of the LCS of X, Y. Experimental result on the gene sequences of tigr database using MPP parallel computer Shenteng 1800 shows that our algorithm can find the exact solutions significantly more efficiently than other LCS algorithms},

abstract = {A fast algorithm named FAST_LCS is presented for the longest common substring (LCS) problem. The algorithm firstly seeks the successors of the initial identical character tuples according to successor tables to obtain all the identical tuples and their levels. Then the result of LCS can be obtained by tracing back from the identical character tuple with the largest level. For n biosequences X 1, X2, ..., Xn, the time complexity of sequentially execution of our algorithm is O(L). Here L is the number of identical character tuples. The time complexity of our parallel algorithm is O(|LCS|), where LCS is the length of the longest common substring of X1, X2, ... , Xn. This time complexity is independent of the number of sequences n. Some experiments have been conducted on the gene sequences of tigr database using MPP parallel computer Shenteng 1800. The results show that our algorithm is accurate and more efficient than other LCS algorithms},
