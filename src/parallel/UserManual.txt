USING THE PARALLEL VERSION OF THE LCS LENGTH ALGORITHM

The parallel LCS algorithm implemented in this project is a dynamic table algorithm parallelized with the wavefront method, implemented in Java.

== Test Data ==
In order to run this program, we need two test data sets. A resonable data set to use is 64KB in size and can be prepared easily by the following two commands:

dd if=/dev/urandom of=test1a bs=64k count=1
dd if=/dev/urandom of=test1b bs=64k count=1

== Run The Test ==
One a pair of similarly sized, random data sets are generated, you can run the LCS algorithm:

java -Dpj.np=<#THREADS> DynamicClu test1a test1b

Java runtime option 'mx256M' allows you to tune the memory upperbound used by the Java VM. You may need this if you generate a large enough dataset.

One invoked, the program will produce two result after a few minutes.
